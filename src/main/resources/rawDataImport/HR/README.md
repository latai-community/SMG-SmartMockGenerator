# Human Resources Sample Schema



## Schema Description

Human Resources (`HR`) is a small sample schema resembling an HR department.
In the Human Resource (`HR`) records, each employee has a
identification number, e-mail address, job identification code, salary,
and manager. Some employees earn commissions in addition to their salary.

The company also tracks information about jobs within the organization.
Each job has an identification code, job title, and a minimum and
maximum salary range for the job. Some employees have been with the
company for a long time and have held different positions within
the company. When an employee resigns, the duration the employee
was working, the job identification number, and the department are recorded.

The sample company is regionally diverse, so it tracks the locations of its
warehouses and departments. Each employee is assigned to a department, and
each department is identified either by a unique department number or a
short name. Each department is associated with one location, and each location
has a full address that includes the street name, postal code, city,
state or province, and the country code.

In places where the departments and warehouses are located, the company records
details such as the country name, currency symbol, currency name, and the
region where the country is located geographically.

## Install Instructions

1. Connect as privileged user with rights to create another user (`SYSTEM`, `ADMIN`, etc.)
2. Run the `hr_install.sql` script to create the `HR` (Human Resources) schema
3. You are prompted for:
   1. `password` - enter an Oracle Database compliant password
   2. `tablespace` - if you do not enter a tablespace, the default database tablespace is used

**Note:** If the HR schema already exists, it is removed/dropped and
a fresh HR schema is installed

### Dependencies and Requirements

- Oracle Database 19c and higher
- Access to `hr_install.sql`, `hr_create.sql`, `hr_populate.sql`, `hr_code.sql`
- Scripts need to be run as a privileged user with rights to create and drop another user (`SYSTEM`, `ADMIN`, etc.).

## Uninstall Instructions

1. Connect as privileged user with rights to create another user (`SYSTEM`, `ADMIN`, etc.)
2. Run the `hr_uninstall.sql ` script to remove the `HR` (Human Resources) schema
